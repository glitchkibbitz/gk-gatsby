            <p>
                Shortly before PAX West 2019, a stroke of good mazel brought Glitch Kibbitz into existence. Their first performance took place in PAX's Jamspace, featuring 9 original arrangements of video game tunesâ€”all written and practiced in the month before the event. (Hopefully it didn't show too much...)
            </p><p>
                After PAX, GK continued to expand their repertoire, and followed up with a performance at the MAGFest 2020 Belvedere Lobby Bar. Over 2020 and 2021, they collaborated remotely, creating several tracks for Materia Community albums, 2 singles, and a self-titled EP.
